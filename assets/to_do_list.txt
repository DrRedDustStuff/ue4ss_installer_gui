Next:

# automated releases pack windows exe into the linux release somehow, fix this
# fix installs that only have ue4ss files
# sometimes it doesn't properly remember the preferences of the checkboxes, probably related to force toggling off standard/portable
# bring back keep mods and settings and make uninstall more robust


Later:

# have the uninstall and installing check all files were purged/installed at the end and push screen based on that
    if the passed zip is invalid or something it shouldn't be successful either


Maybes:

# async dir scan/loading screen
# option to configure a specific ue4ss installation, like toggline mods, ini values, etc...
