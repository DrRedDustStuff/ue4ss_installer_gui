To Do List:

Next:

# add menu sections for the new gui settings stuff, also add font size scale float multiplier
# Improve dir scanning, for games with a lot of dirs it can be too long
# when uninstalling ue4ss from a game install dir where the game is already gone, it needs to refresh the game button list
# install from url option/other options
# configure lua/C++ menu
# configure bp mods menu
# configure ue4ss settings menu
# developer section
# basic/advanced mode
# theming
# improve ue4ss install detection, when it hasn't been installed from this app
# clear untranslated fallback


Later:

# async dir scan/loading screen


Maybes:

# optional list of downloads links to extract to various places in the ue4ss install
