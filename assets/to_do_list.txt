Next:

# offline check removes social buttons
# loading screen for scanning games
# fix installs that only have ue4ss files
# seems at times dupes for games can appear from the above as well right now
# sometimes it doesn't properly remember the preferences of the checkboxes
# sometimes the install button can be pressed, when no file to install is selected, prevent this somehow
# bring back keep mods and settings and make uninstall more robust


Later:

# have the uninstall and installing check all files were purged/installed at the end and push screen based on that
    if the passed zip is invalid or something it shouldn't be successful either


Maybes:

# async dir scan/loading screen
# option to configure a specific ue4ss installation, like toggline mods, ini values, etc...
