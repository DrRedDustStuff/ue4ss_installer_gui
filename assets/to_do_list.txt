To Do List:


Next:
# make text button with no bacjground then does not change on press, just to have centered text
# get rid of extra space in footer in online mode
# global settings files, accessible via the settings menu, add things like custom font path, lang select, etc... here
# global font scale settings option
#
# bottom buttons are not aligned at the center in online mode
# when uninstalling ue4ss from a game install dir where the game is already gone, it needs to refresh the game button list
# install from url option/other options
# improve ue4ss install detection, when it hasn't been installed from this app
# clear untranslated fallback
# remember window height, width, and position preferences
#
# occasionally double entries happen, it seems paths are being messed up c:/ versus C:/ for example
#
# configure lua/C++ menu
# configure bp mods menu
# configure ue4ss settings menu
# developer section

Later:
# create preset, install from preset options, for specific games/situations
# basic/advanced mode
# better theming

# optional list of downloads links to extract to various places in the ue4ss install
